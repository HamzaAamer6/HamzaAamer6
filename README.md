I'm Hamza, currently studying at FAST NUCES Islamabad in Pakistan. I'm passionate about learning programming languages, gathering certifications, and using them to solve real-world problems. I'm especially passionate about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 

I'm always looking for ways to expand my skillset and become a more advanced programmer. I believe knowledge is power, and I strive to learn as much as I can in the field of computer science.
